In this demo, you’ll learn how to use the Trend Micro Vision One Platform, to quickly detect and respond to ransomware attack, minimizing the impact that this kind of threat can cause to companies.

--------
## Use Cases Covered in this Demo
With this demo, you can simulate Real World uses cases like:

<b>- A company is running important business applications on an EC2 Instance. A Cloud Engineer, when trying to download the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, by mistake will download a run a compromised version of Mozilla Firefox. After that, the affected EC2 Instance will start communicating with an Command and Control Server managed by the attacker.</b>

<b>- During this attack, the attacker will have access sensitive information, that will be exfiltrated and before disconnecting from the affected environment, the attacker will drop a ransomware, requesting money to decrypt the sensitive data present on the affected computer.</b>

<b>- In this demo you will discover how just the Trend Micro Vision One XDR Agent could help detecting this attack, and automatically responding to it, avoiding other devices present in the same network to be compromised (isolating the affected computer before it is used to do lateral movement and compromise other computers or services).</b>
