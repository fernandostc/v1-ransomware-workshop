In this demo, you’ll learn how to use the Trend Micro Vision One Platform to quickly detect and respond to attacks that intend to exfiltrate sensitive data and encrypt files (ransomware), minimizing the impact that this kind of threat can have on companies.

--------
## Use Cases Covered in this Demo
With this demo, you can simulate Real World uses cases like:

> Data Exfiltration on an AWS EC2 Instance

- A company is running business applications on an EC2 Instance. A Cloud Engineer, when trying to download the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, by mistake will download a run a compromised version of Mozilla Firefox. After that, the affected EC2 Instance will start communicating with a Command and Control Server managed by an attacker.

- During this attack, the attacker will have access to sensitive information that will be exfiltrated. Before disconnecting from the affected environment, the attacker will drop ransomware, requesting money to decrypt the sensitive computer's sensitive data.

In this demo, you will discover how the Trend Micro Vision One XDR Agent could help detect this attack and automatically respond to it.
