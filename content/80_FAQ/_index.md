    * If this is the first time you are using this material, you have to follow all the instructions highlighted on the item above. If this is the second time or more, you can jump to the steps <b>3.3- ZTSA Client Based Acces - part 3</b> and <b> 4.1- ZTSA Internet Access Control</b>. In this way, you can re-use all the configurations you have done in your previous demo, and go directly to the point (demonstrating the solution).
