## TREND MICRO™ VISION ONE - See more. Respond faster.

With today’s ever-evolving threat landscape, you need capabilities in place to help you detect and respond rapidly to threats that may breach your defenses. Today, many organizations use multiple, separate security layers to detect threats across their email, endpoints, servers, cloud infrastructure, and networks, leading to siloed threat information and an overload of uncorrelated alerts.

Investigating threats across all these disparate solutions makes for a very piecemeal and manual investigation process that can miss threats altogether due to lack of visibility and correlation. Many detection and response solutions only look at endpoints, missing threats that pass through user emails, servers, cloud workloads, and networks. This results in a very limited view of the attacker’s activities and an inadequate, incomplete response.

Trend Micro Vision One is a purpose-built threat defense platform that provides added value and new benefits beyond XDR solutions, allowing you to see more and respond faster. Providing deep and broad extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities that collect and automatically correlate data across multiple security layers—email, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks—Trend Micro Vision One prevents the majority of attacks with automated protection.

Native sensors and protection points—coupled with the XDR capabilities that stitch together threat activity across layers— allow for the quick detection of complex attacks that bypass
prevention. This provides an unmatched understanding of the activity data in your environment and a balanced approach to security, as teams can quickly see the story of an attack and respond faster and more confidently. The visibility and efficiency that is provided by Trend Micro Vision One makes great security teams even better, enabling them to do more with
less. In addition, the Trend Micro™ Managed XDR service can augment teams with expert threat hunting and investigation.

### KEY BUSINESS ISSUES


<b>• Stealthy threats continue to evade even the best defenses

• Disconnected security layers with siloed tools and data sets make it difficult to correlate information and detect critical threats

• Too many alerts and overloaded organizations don’t have the time or resources to investigate

• Consolidated visibility into an organization’s current security status, trending over time, is hard to come by and limits the ability to know what to focus on and where action should be taken</b>

### INTRODUCING TREND MICRO RISK INSIGHTS
Risk Insights equips security teams with the ability to continually monitor the security posture of their organization, exposing unseen risks to make better decisions. Across the organization, Risk Insights assists:

- <b> SOC/Security teams –
Uncover undiscovered risks and gain insight into what needs immediate attention. View risks by user, device, and application, or at the organization level.

- <b> CSO/Leadership –
Understand the organization’s security posture, whether it is improving or declining, and gain visibility into how it compares to peers in your industry, region, or organization size.

- <b> Network security –
Incorporate health scores into access control solutions and make more informed automated decisions when following a Zero Trust strategy.

#### ADVANTAGES
#### Increase visibility into threat and posture risks

- <b> Provides continuous risk analysis of devices, identities, content, and applications. This includes active risks such as:</b>

    -- Suspicious or anomalous user activity

    -- Indicators of attack (IoA), behaviors, or detections

    -- Potential risks such as vulnerabilities, exposed identities, or risky cloud app access
- <b> Allows for deeper insight into your organization’s health level—pulled from endpoint, email, mobile, network XDR telemetry, and other data sources—to uncover hidden risks</b>
- <b> Leverages intel from leading Trend Micro vulnerability research experts to detect unpatched operating system and application vulnerabilities within your environment</b>
- <b> Instills a Zero Trust strategy throughout your organization by providing your security team with continuous health assessments of your identities and devices</b>

---
### Prioritization and automation for better risk-based decisions
- <b> Highlights the most critical risks affecting your organization so your team can maintain a trusted security environment</b>
- <b> Uses global and local exploit intelligence to prioritize patching of device vulnerabilities. Identifies if prevention rules are available to protect against exploits until Patch deployment.</b>
- <b> Mitigates and contains risks across the infrastructure from just one console.</b>
- <b> Shares health scores with Trend Micro and third-party access control solutions—including Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) to make automated and well-informed decisions.</b>

### Respond Faster

-<b> Timely detection models - New expert detection rules are added regularly, based on what Trend Micro threat experts are finding in the wild. Enables automatic searching for new indicators of compromise (IoCs) with Trend Micro threat feed.</b> 

-<b> Faster investigation - Quickly visualize the full attack story. XDR automatically pieces together fragments of malicious activity and paints a complete picture across security layers.</b> 

-<b> Automated - Protection layer remediation capabilities deal with threats like ransomware (e.g. auto-restore any files damaged prior to detection) or to clean up malware automatically.</b> 

-<b> Complete response - Contain threats more easily, assess the impact, and action the response across email, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks, all from within the platform.</b> 

-<b> Proactive policy management - With XDR-driven insight, analysts can proactively adjust applicable product policy parameters to continually optimize defenses and provision the agent.</b>
