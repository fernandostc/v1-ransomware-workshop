## Demo Prevention Mode 
With this demo you will find how to use the Vision One XDR Agent to help detecting and responding to attacks targeting sensitive data, and using traditional tools (not malicious) to help with data exfiltration and encryption (randomware).

### Attacking Phase
In this demo, we are using the Mitre Caldera tool, to help us executing the attack sequence. The Mitre Caldera helps to deploy instructions based on the Mitre ATT&CK Framework, allowing us to evaluate security solutions based on real-world use cases.

#### What are Tactics in the ATT&CK Framework?
ATT&CK stands for adversarial tactics, techniques, and common knowledge. The tactics are a modern way of looking at cyberattacks. Rather than looking at the results of an attack, aka an indicator of compromise (IoC), it identifies tactics that indicate an attack is in progress. Tactics are the “why” of an attack technique.

The Enterprise ATT&CK matrix has 14 tactics. In this demo, we are covering the following highlighted tactics.

- Reconnaissance
- Resource Development
- Initial Access
- Execution
- Persistence
- Privilege Escalation
- Defense Evasion
- Credential Access
- Discovery
- Lateral Movement
- Command & Control
- Collection
- Exfiltration
- Impact
